# D7 Verification & Validation


## 1. Description

Designed for customers who continuously check for out of stock items, AlertX is an inventory alert system that notifies a shopper as soon as their desired product comes back into stock. Our solution offers a customizable notification system to ensure you know exactly when you can purchase an item, unlike most product's websites. With a clean and functioning interface, our user will successfully receive gathered information about products and their stock status quickly so that they can worry less about a certain item being sold-out again.

Our system will be kept relatively simple and straight forward. Through our web interface, the customer will be able to browse products that they would like to be selected to be notified for. After product selection, there is a notification option. Here there is a SMS or email option, where the user can select their preference and even choose both options. Our product uses a Database; within this Database, basic user information is documented to help notify the user of their product via notification. The central requirement of our system is that restock notifications are accurate and up to date with the current market. Users have access to their own search history where they can view everything they track. Depending on which is selected, the client’s information and the product they selected will be stored in our database. When the time comes that the product they selected is back in stock, we can pull their information from our data base and send them their specified notification. With items in high demand and limited supply, we offer a fighting chance to consumers. AlertX is an inventory tracker that allows shoppers to avoid the wait, track it once and get a personal notification when that item is back in store.

## 2. Verification (tests)
Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the product.

### 2.1. Unit test
A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated
from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, you should have automated tests for the
main components of your project. Provide the following information:

* 2.1.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest,
etc.):
* 2.1.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
* 2.1.3. An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your
answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
* 2.1.4. A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution.

Grading: 8 points. Criteria: adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests,
quality of the tests, adequate use of Mock objects, print screen showing successful tests
execution.

### 2.2. Integration test
An integration test is an automated test that verifies the implementation of a business rule
that involves multiple components with the goal of certifying that they work together to
produce the expected result. They are often performed in the same test platform as the
unit tests. Provide the following information:

* 2.2.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests:
* 2.2.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated integration tests are
located.
* 2.2.3. An example of an integration test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the
test and an explanation about what parts of the system are being exercised by
this test.
* 2.2.4. A print screen showing the result of the integration tests execution.

Grading: 5 points. Criteria: adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests,
quality of the tests, adequate example of an integration test, print screen showing
successful tests execution.

### 2.3. Acceptance
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the
user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested
without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

* 2.3.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon
Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.):
* 2.3.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are
located.
* 2.3.3. An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to
the test and an explanation about the tested feature.
* 2.3.4. A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution.

Grading: 8 points. Criteria: adequate choice of a test framework, coverage of the tests,
quality of the tests, adequate example of an acceptance test, print screen/video showing
successful tests execution.

## 3. Validation (user evaluation)
Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. You started the software
inception by talking to users and stakeholders. Now it is time to check if you are on the
right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this
deliverable the following information:

Script: The script should have the tasks that you will give to the user, what you are going
to collect, and what you are going to ask. Do not forget to add questions about the users’
general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the
homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed
questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On
the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at
the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script (aim to check if you
are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way).

Results: Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users. Report the data that you
collected.

Reflections: Reflect on what you observed. Some questions that you can explore: What
features worked well? What can be changed? How is the learning curve of your system?
Did the users preform the tasks as you expected? Did the users’ actions produce the 
results they expected? What did the users like the most? Is your value proposition
accomplished?

### Reflections
**User: Rhianna Pedro**

The feedback from Rhianna, we realized that we needed a much more appealing design to our website. Her initial thoughts on the website were mostly about appearance. The more she looked at it, the more she kept talking about wanting more color and pictures. We didn't have much time to fully make the website look appealing or nice, and that's what she noticed as well. 

**User: Kolin Galidiano**

Kolin's feedback focused on the appearance of the website and functionality. He also noticed that the website looked plain but he liked the simplicty of the webpage and how it was easy to navigate everything. However, he did make some suggestions about what we could add to our webpage. He said that we could add more products and some reviews to the home page about customers liking our application so that people are more attracted to our services. He also suggested a "Profile" page for users to save the items they want restock notifications on. Kolin really looks forward to AlertX being more developed and having a bigger reputation.
