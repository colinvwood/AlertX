# D.4 Implementation 1

Grading: 40 points
For this deliverable, you should have a fully functional piece of software that delivers a set of 
features (don’t need to be the complete set, but it needs to be a working prototype). Structure 
your deliverable according to the following sections. See the “Team Project Instructions” for 
details about formatting. 

## 1. Introduction

Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the 
value proposition and the description of the main features of the software. At the end of 
the introduction, include links to your project on GitHub and Trello, which should be up to-date.

Grading (2 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description 
should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the links to 
GitHub and Trello, which should be up-to-date.

## 2. Implemented requirements

List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for 
this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement, 
link to the issue, link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who 
implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the 
implemented feature (if applicable). Order the requirements by the name of the student 
who implemented it.
We expect that you implement/prototype features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 
Requirements). We expect that all the members of the group have been involved in some 
programming activities and report several pull requests. 

### Example:

* Requirement: _As a Student, I want to add a homework assignment so that I can organize my ToDo 
list._
* Issue:  (link to your Trello or GitHub issue)
* Pull request: https://github.com/user/project/pull/426
* Implemented by: Martin Fowler
* Approved by: Ada Lovelace
* Print screen: A print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable)2
Remember that all source code should be submitted by means of pull requests and the 
quality assurance person in the team should review and approve each pull request. 
* For more information about pull requests:
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ 

Grading (10 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, adequate use of language, and amount of work put 
into the implementation. Students can receive different grades depending on their 
involvement. It is expected that all members contribute with non-trivial implementation.
All pull request should be approved and integrated by the quality assurance person. You 
should follow an adequate workflow (description of the requirement on the issue tracker, 
submission of the implemented requirement as a pull request, and review of the pull 
request by another developer. 

## 3. Adopted technologies

List the adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.

Grading (2 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 4. Learning/training

Describe the strategies employed by the team to learn the adopted technologies. 

Grading (2 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 5. Deployment

Describe how you are deploying your system in production. If you are using AWS, 
remember that AWS Educate offers free credits for students. See the tutorial at 
https://docker-curriculum.com/ on how to create a container and deploy it on AWS. 
Provide a link for the system in production.

Grading (4 points): This section will be graded based on the adequate use of the technology 
and its adequate description.

## 6. Licensing

Inform the license you adopted for your source code (remember to configure GitHub 
accordingly). Explain why you adopted this license. For more information, check 
https://choosealicense.com/ and http://redhat.slides.com/glikins/open-sourcelicensing-101#/

Grading (2 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language.

## 7. Readme File

You should also prepare your repository for receiving new contributors. See an example 
of a Redme.md file at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2 3
Besides the Readme.md file, your repository should contain a CONTRIBUTING.md 
file, a LICENSE file, and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. Search online for some 
examples of these files. In this section of the deliverable, put links to these files on GitHub.
In the Readme file, the current version should be stated. You should follow the Semantic 
Versioning schema (https://semver.org/). Tag the GitHub repository accordingly
(https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). 
Remember that only stable code should be included in the release. Code that is still under 
development should be in branches.

Grading (4 points): This section will be based on the presence and quality of the 
information presented in the files.

## 8. Look & feel

Describe the approach you adopted to design your user interface. Include some 
screenshots.

Grading (4 points): This section will be graded based on the appearance (aesthetics) and 
usability (ease of use) of the system.

## 9. Lessons learned

In retrospective, describe what your team learned during this first release and what you 
are planning to change for the second release. 

Grading (2 points): Adequate reflection about problems and solutions, clear description 
with adequate use of language.

## 10.Demo

Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading (8 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the 
evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance 
of the demonstrated functionalities, correctness of the functionalities, and quality of the 
developed system from the external point of view (user interface).

## Additional Grading criteria

Penalties in the deliverable will be imposed for participants with a low level of coding activities 
and projects with inadequate usage of the Trello and GitHub features (e.g., pull requests) or 
insufficient implementation of the system.
