## 1. Introduction
AlertX is a inventory alert system that intends to give customers a better shot at obtaining a specifed item that is frequently out of stock. Recently, a lot of markets have been dried up and left many consumers struggling to purchase their desired products. Using online retailer's APIs, we can give users the upper-hand by alerting them as soon as their specified product comes back into stock. Notifications can be customized to be delivered via email and/or text message, whichever suites their needs.
