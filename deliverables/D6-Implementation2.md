# D.6 Implementation 2 

Grading: 49 points
This deliverable should describe the second release of your project. A release is a fully functional
software that delivers a set of features (don’t need to be the complete set but they need to be
usable). Structure your deliverable using the following sections. See the “Team Project
Instructions” for details about formatting.

## 1. Introduction 
Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This description should contain the
value proposition and the main features. At the end of the introduction, include links to
your project on GitHub and Trello, which should be up to date.

Grading (2 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, and adequate use of language. The description
should be consistent with the current state of the project. You should include the links to
GitHub and Trello, which should be up-to-date.

## 2. Implemented requirements
List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for
this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement,
link to the issue, link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who
implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the
implemented feature (if applicable). Order the requirements by the name of the student
who implemented it.

Remember that all source code should be submitted by means of pull requests and the
quality assurance person in the team should review and approve each pull request. For
more information about pull requests:
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/

Grading (25 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness,
thoroughness, consistency, coherence, adequate use of language, and amount of work put
into the implementation. Students can receive different grades depending on their
involvement. It is expected that all members contribute with non-trivial implementation.
All pull request should be approved and integrated by the quality assurance person. You
should follow an adequate workflow (description of the requirement on the issue tracker,
submission of the implemented requirement as a pull request, and review of the pull
request by another developer.

## 3. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading (15 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on
the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the
relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, correctness of the functionalities, and
quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).

## 4. Code quality
Describe how your team managed code quality. What were your policies, conventions,
adopted best practices, etc. to foster high quality code?

Grading (4 points): Adequate list of practices that were adopted to improve code quality
and clear description with adequate use of language.

## 5. Lessons learned
In retrospective, describe what your team learned during this second release and what
would you change if you would continue developing the project:

* Learning a new environment is difficult - As a team, we put many hours into this week’s deliverable, the majority of which went into understanding how to implement a new API and working with HTML/Python for sending emails to customers who sign up with a form to get notified on restocks.

* Developing a client-face deliverable is complicated - Our product’s value relies heavily on the backend since we designed it to select what product the user wants a restock email on. Unfortunately, it isn’t very easy to deliver that email until the API actually sends a message, when something is back in stock, to your device from the database. Since our product’s purpose is around client-facing, email/message-communicated deliverables, we spent our time doing research around the API we plan on using and  HTML/Python to at least write the structure of the software. 

* More time to continue developing the project would be great - If our team would continue developing the project, we would probably change our time management with the deliverables and dedicate more time on our website. We had many barriers during the process of making AlertX, so with more time, resources, and research, we could probably make everything better. However, with the time frame we have and putting lots of effort into our deliverables, we were only able to do the minimum.
