Consumers often have the problem of waiting for **products** that are frequently out of stock. For those consumers who check for items that are frequently out of stock, AlertX is a notification system that <ins>notifies a shopper as soon as their desired product comes back in stock</ins>.

One of the key requirements in our system is <ins>being able to have quick restock notifications</ins> so that once the <ins>consumer gets a restock notification via email or text</ins>, they won't need to worry about that certain item being sold out again, without them knowing.
