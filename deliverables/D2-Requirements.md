# Requirements

## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Problem Statement
(View D2. Requirements for rubric, it has some visuals I can not copy)

### 1.2 Product Position Statement
(View D2. Requirements for rubric, it has some visuals I can not copy)

### 1.3 Value Proposition and Customer Segment
Report the value propositions and customer segments of your product. Make sure that
your value proposition is coherent with the product position statement and contains the
following elements: i) what your product is; ii) the target customer; iii) the value your
product provides; and iv) why your product is unique.
Example:
Value proposition: MyPrioritizationApp is a crowdsourced planning app {(i) what your
product is} that allows college students {(ii) target costumer} to make better use of their time {(iii)
the value your product provides}, prioritizing homework based on more accurate information of
required time and complexity of the assignments {(iv) why your product is unique}.”
Consumer segment: College students who have many parallel homework assignments
Grading: 3 points (1 point each section) – The content of the subsections should contain all
the required elements, follow the provided template, and be consistent with each other.
The text should not contain typos or grammar issues.

## 2. Stakeholders
Make a list of all stakeholders of the project with a brief description of each one of them,
emphasizing any responsibilities with the project. Examples of stakeholders include users,
clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc.
Grading: 1 point – The stakeholders can’t be too generic or specific. The list should reflect
what was described in Section 1.

## 3. Functional Requirements (features)
Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are
enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition
and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous
deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help defining the requirements. While
writing the requirements, focus on capabilities needed and not on how they should be
implemented.
Grading: 2 points – The list should be comprehensive (remember that you are not expect
to implement all the requirements by the end of the course but you should list them).
Follow the same pattern to describe all the requirements. The list of requirements should
be coherent with the previous sections.

## 4. Non-functional requirements
Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your
software. Explain their importance. Follow the terminology of ISO/IEC 25010:2011. For
each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to
provide verifiability for the requirement. You can find more details at the following URL:

3
Grading: 2 points – Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important,
provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.

## 5. MVP
What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How?
Grading: 4 points – Describe what would be considered the Minimal Viable Product and
how it will be tested (e.g., via implementation, prototyping, Wizard of Woz, etc.). Make
clear what you are going to validate. The MVP should be coherent with the previous
sections.

## 6. Use Cases

### 6.1 Use Case Diagram
Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that
you can use, such as http://draw.io and https://creately.com/
Grading: 4 points – Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent
with what was listed in sections 1 and 2. The use case diagram should be coherent with
the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be
adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.

### 6.2 Use Case Descriptions and interface sketch
Present one complete use case description for each member of the group. Therefore, if
the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be
individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency for the whole
document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to
describe. Follow the template provided by OpenUP to describe the use cases (see also the
example):
https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~johnmc/courses/Publish/openup/guidances/templates
/resources/uc_specification_tpl.dot
After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will
be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability.

**Use Case**: Receive SMS Notification 

**Actor**: SMS Receiver 

**Description**: The User will use our services to receive a notification Via SMS.

**Preconditions**: They have a registered account with our services and have a device that can receive SMS.

**Postconditions**: The AlertX User will now receive catered notifications Via SMS on specified products that recently have come back in stock.

**Basic Flow**:

1. User will browse and select which items to be notified about .
2. The user can than select their notification preference.
3. To be notified Via SMS the user will enter their phone number.
4. The user will now receive catered notifications on the specified products.


**Alternative Flow**:
1. If in step 3 of the basic flow an invalid phone number is entered.
	a. The user will be promped to enter a valid phone number.
	b. The use case resumes at basic flow step 4.

Grading: 4 points – Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface
sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the
system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.

## 7. User Stories
Write two user stories for each member of the group. They can be related to the same
features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a
<ROLE>, I want <SOMETHING> so that <GOAL>."
Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will
demand using the planning poker approach.

Grading: 6 points – Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate
level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation
for each user story.

## 8. Issue Tracker
The user stories should be registered as cards in a public board at Trello.com or another
issue tracker. Include here the link for your issue tracker and a screenshot of what you
did. From now on, we expect that you use an issue tracker to manage the project tasks.

Link To Trello: https://trello.com/b/Y4P9ZZVL/alertx

Grading: 4 points – Provide the URL and screenshot of the issue tracker. The user stories
should be registered there.
