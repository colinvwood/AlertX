5. MVP
Our MVP is going to give our clients access to a limited selection of "popular" items that
are typically out of stock. Customers will then be notified via their preferred delivery
method (email or SMS) when their selected item(s) come back into stock. Many
interviewees claimed that a "pretty" and easy to use interface was essential; The
website will be user friendly and simple to navigate to ensure a pleasent and productive
experience for our clients. Since we are already going to be sending customers
emails/SMS, we can directly monitor and validate our MVP by analyzing links that are
clicked within; Customers will also have the opportunity to send feedback via our
dedicated customer feedback email.
