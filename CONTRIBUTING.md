## Not sure where to start? 

Either contact an owner via discord or start right on github! Contribute to AlertX on github by opening an issue on the correct repository when you find you want to make changes. Feel free to review the [issue tracker](https://github.com/colinvwood/AlertX/issues) as well as on [trello](https://trello.com/b/Y4P9ZZVL/alertx). All users are welcome so come and start a conversation with us!

One of the best ways you can contribute is by using Don't Panic yourself, and opening issues at the github repository when you find things that could be improved. If you're a developer, feel free to review the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ChrisKeefe/DontPanic/issues), and start a conversation with us if you see something you'd like to work on. All comers are welcome.
